After initial exploration of the existing jupyter notebook (as well as assorted webpages) we have decided on an initial strategy of team selection as follows:
* Select the 4 cheapest players to maximise cash available for the 'on the pitch' 11
  * Sorting the dataframe by cost (ascending) revealed the cheapest 20 players are all goalkeepers and defenders
  * The player type split for our full 15 players is: 2 Goalkeepers; 5 Defenders; 5 Midfielders; 3 Forwards
  * The player type split for our 11 on-pitch players has to meet the following criteria: Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.
  * This means the 4 on the bench should consist of: 1 goalkeeper; 2 defenders; cheapest midfielder/ forward
  * Where there are multiple players of the same cheapest price in a player type category we should pick the most valuable
* The cheapest goalkeepers and defenders (3/4 of our bench) cost £4 million and the cheapest midfield/ forward (1/4 of our bench) costs £4.5 million totalling £16.5 million 
* This leaves £83.5 million to spend on players we like!
